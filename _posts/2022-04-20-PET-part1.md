### INTRODUCTION ###

The purpose of the experiment was to understand and characterize a Positron Emmission Tomography (PET) imaging system. It consists of X# parts:

**1. Taking scans along a single dimension, with a single radiation source.**
   
   This allowed for me to understand the effects of imaging parameters on the resolution of the system. 
   
**2. Imaging two radiation sources with 1 additional rotational degree of freedom**
   
   This allows for 2 dimensional image to be reconstructed.

**3. Quantifying the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) of the system.**

   Considering the tradeoffs that arise between radiometric and spatial resolutions with changes in aperture, I characterize the system's SNR.

## Background on PET

Positron Emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality which uses [beta-positive decay](https://www.britannica.com/science/beta-plus-decay) of a radiation sample as its imaging energy source. This decay is well suited to its purpose because it produces two photons which are emitted in opposing directions, due to the conservation of energy when a positron and electron annihilate inside the radiation source. The characteristic along-axis emission of beta-positive decay provides the geometric information which essential to image reconstruction from the scan data; two opposing detectors are used and when they detect photons simultaneously, it is known that the source of emission lies somewhere along the line between them. Though the point of emmission along the line in 3D space is unknown, by scanning from a multitude of angles and thus building a collection of lines-of-emmission, an image of the distribution of radiation can be made by using an [inverse radon transform](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/the-inverse-radon-transformation.html). In medical PET systems, multiple angles of detection are achieved by having a ring of detectors surrounding the imaging area. 

## Experiment Setup

In the present experiment, the set-up consitutes just two detectors, directly opposing each other as shown in the photographs below. Either 1 or 2 radioactive samples can then be placed in the "arm" of the device, and the arm is capable of being programmed to move along the track in one dimension, and rotate in the horizontal plane. This simulates a ring-detector set up, though one scan takes longer as the arm must be held in position at each angle, rather than taking all measurements at once. These 2 degrees of freedom enable me to generate a 2 dimensional image via the inverse radon transform.

The detectors used are [photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)](https://www.britannica.com/technology/electrical-and-electronics-engineering). As their name (somewhat) implies, they amplify a low powered radiation signal into a larger, more manageable signal. Their engineering is quite interesting, but I will let the link above serve as the explanation and continue to focus on the experiment at hand.

The signals from the PMTs then travel through a bank of hardware shown below. The key aspects of this processing are : 

1) amplification

   further increase the signal amplitude

2) single channel analyzer
   
   determine if the pulse is characteristic of the targeted radiation emmission

3) universal coincedence
   
   deteremine if two signals occur within a sufficiently short time window to be considered from the same decay event.

4) counter
   
   count the number of coincident events at the given scanning position
   
   
## 1 dimensional scan

To begin, a single radiation source was imaged by simply moving it in 1 dimension: along track. Rotation with a single source would have little effect because the source is small and spherical. This is mainly to garner insight into how varying the parameters of the imaging system effects the output.

This allows for us to gain insight into the parameter response of the imaing profile with different apertures.

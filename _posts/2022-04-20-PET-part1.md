## INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of the experiment was to understand and characterize a Positron Emmission Tomography (PET) imaging system. In this write up, I provide a brief background of PET technology, describe the experiment setup and hardware, and outline the methods used to characterized the system. All figures and diagrams were made by me using Python and Adobe Illustrator.

        Considering the tradeoffs that arise between radiometric and spatial resolutions with changes in aperture, I characterize the system's SNR.

## 1. Background on PET

Positron Emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality which uses [beta-positive decay](https://www.britannica.com/science/beta-plus-decay) of a radiation sample as its imaging energy source. This decay is well suited to its purpose because it produces two photons which are emitted in opposing directions, due to the conservation of energy when a positron and electron annihilate inside the radiation source. The characteristic along-axis emission of beta-positive decay provides the geometric information which essential to image reconstruction from the scan data; two opposing detectors are used and when they detect photons simultaneously, it is known that the source of emission lies somewhere along the line between them. Though the point of emmission along this line in 3D space is unknown, by scanning from a multitude of angles and thus building a collection of lines-of-emmission, an image of the distribution of radiation can be made by using an [inverse radon transform](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/the-inverse-radon-transformation.html). In medical PET systems, multiple angles of detection are achieved by having a ring of detectors surrounding the imaging area. 

## 2. Experiment Setup

In the present experiment, the set-up consitutes just two detectors, directly opposing each other as shown in the photographs below. Either 1 or 2 radioactive samples can then be placed in the "arm" of the device, and the arm is capable of being programmed to move along the track in one dimension, and rotate in the horizontal plane. This simulates a ring-detector set up, though one scan takes longer as the arm must be held in position at each angle, rather than taking all measurements at once. These 2 degrees of freedom enable me to generate a 2 dimensional image via the inverse radon transform.

The detectors used are [photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)](https://www.britannica.com/technology/electrical-and-electronics-engineering). As their name (somewhat) implies, they amplify a low powered radiation signal into a larger, more manageable signal. Their engineering is quite interesting, but I will let the link above serve as the explanation and continue to focus on the experiment at hand.

The signals from the PMTs then travel through the hardware bank shown below, from right to left. The key processing steps are : 

1) **Amplification**

   Further increase the signal amplitude

2) **Single channel analyzer**
   
   Determine if the pulse is characteristic of the targeted radiation emmission

3) **Universal coincedence **
   
   Deteremine if two signals occur within a sufficiently short time window to be considered from the same decay event.

4) **Counter**
   
   Count the number of coincident photons detected by both channels at the given scanning position

The radiation source is moved along the track in incremental steps, and held in place while the count is recorded onto the lab computer. 

Parameters of the experiment with major implications on the scan output include:

- Linear step size (mm)
- Rotational step size (degrees)
- Exposure time per step (s)
- Aperture (mm)


## 3. Results
### 3.1. monodimensional scan 

To begin, a single radiation source was imaged by moving it along track in 1 dimension. This step is mainly to garner insight into how varying the parameters of exposure time and aperture effects the scan.

|Coincident photon counts from a single Na-22 radiation source measured for varying distance from the center of the imaging apparatus perpendicular to the axis of the detector pair. The distance range of 15mm was covered in increments of 0.2mm and the source was held stationary for 100 seconds at each increment. The mean of 5 trials is plotted with error bars representing one standard deviation from the mean for each position. The aperture for this run was 3mm, which is distinguishable in the data as the full width of the primary signal (ie, the steeply sloped regime between -1.5mm and 1.5mm). The primary signal contains information beneficial to image reconstruction, while the tails outside of it contribute to the background noise. The characterization of the noise signal and its use in isolating the primary signal is crucial to the measurement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the scanning system.|

### 3.2. Imaging two radiation sources with two degrees of freedom

Profiles of two source imaging at eifferent angles look like this:

I found this experiment to be particularly interesting for its use of inexpensive sound recording equipment to make scientific insights into quantum phenomena. It was also one of the first times I applied concepts of fourier analysis outside of a math class, in an experimental/real world setting. 

Below is my report submitted as coursework for my 2nd year experimental physics lab class.

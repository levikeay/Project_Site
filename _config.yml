# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: >
  Welcome to my portfolio website. I hope to showcase some projects I have done over the years that highlight my interests and abilities.
  <br /><br />I am a graduate of the UBC faculty of Physics with research work experience in UBC's Integrated Remote Sensing Studio and currently working in the realm of InSAR processing. I'm passionate about Imaging, Computer Vision, Signal Processing, and Acoustics, and I love to use Python to automate and streamline procedures. View my projects portfolio for examples of experiments and projects I've undertaken throughout my work experience, education and of personal development.
  <br /><br />Please get in touch if you are interested in working together, or with any questions regarding past projects. All materials on this site are my own. Thanks for your interest and enjoy!
